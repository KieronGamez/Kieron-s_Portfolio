    <h2>What happens when you body is infected with Covid-19</h2>

    <p> When covid enters the body, usually through inhaling the covid particles or having physical contact with someone
      or something that had covid on it, will travel from the nose and mouth into multiple organs, however, it can do
      the
      most damage in the lungs. There, the covid cells will target the epithelial cells, which line your organs. The
      Covid
      cells will then inject their genetic DNA into the cell, infecting it and causing the cell to be confused, but will
      unknowingly be making more and more covid cells. Eventually, the cell will self-destruct and release the covid
      cells
      into the rest of the epithelial cells and infect the billions of cells in the lungs.
