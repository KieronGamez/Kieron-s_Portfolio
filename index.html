  <h1> Hello There </h1>
  <p>I'm <b>Kieron</b>, an aspiring game developer and this is my portfolio </p>

  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p> I'm a 14 year old aspiring game developer at ACS(BR). I play games such as valorant, overwatch 2 and more with
    friends. I also play Dungeons and Dragons as both a player and a dungeon master, and i am currently writing my own
    world for a campaign.</p>


  <p> I have always had a passion for learning and always found learning codes interesting. As someone who, admittidly,
    is
    addicted to gaming, I feel that gaming is also an escape from life that I would love to create and see the joy in
    other people's faces when they game. </p>
